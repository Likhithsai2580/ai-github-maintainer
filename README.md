## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Likhithsai2580/ai-github-maintainer.git
   cd ai-github-maintainer
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys and configuration:
   ```
   cp env.example .env
   ```

4. Customize the `config.yaml` file to suit your needs.

5. Run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

6. To enable the app to run automatically every week and update all repositories present on the user account, ensure the `schedule` library is installed and run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Configuration

The `config.yaml` file allows you to customize various aspects of the AI GitHub Maintainer. Refer to the comments in the file for detailed explanations of each setting.

## Usage

The AI GitHub Maintainer runs on a schedule defined in `config.yaml`. By default, it performs weekly maintenance tasks on all accessible repositories.

You can also trigger maintenance manually using the web interface or by running:
```
python main.py --repo=<repository_name>
```

## Web Interface

Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`. Features include:

- Manual maintenance triggering
- Real-time logs and updates
- Repository activity reports
- Plugin management interface

## Customizing the LLM Provider

To change the LLM provider, update the `LLM_PROVIDER` and `LLM_MODEL` variables in your `.env` file. Supported options include OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, and Gemini.
