## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Likhithsai2580/ai-github-maintainer.git
   cd ai-github-maintainer
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Move `env.example` to `.env` file with your API keys and configuration:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   LLM_PROVIDER=openai
   LLM_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
   ```

4. Customize the `config.yaml` file to suit your needs.

5. Run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Configuration

The `config.yaml` file allows you to customize various aspects of the AI GitHub Maintainer:

- GitHub settings (organization, repositories, access tokens)
- LLM provider and model selection
- Maintenance schedule and frequency
- Feature toggles for specific maintainer capabilities
- Logging configuration and verbosity levels
- Plugin settings and activation
- Caching options for improved performance
- Custom prompts for AI interactions
- Notification settings (email, Slack, Discord)
- CI/CD integration parameters
- Security scan thresholds and policies

Refer to the comments in `config.yaml` for detailed explanations of each setting.

## Usage

The AI GitHub Maintainer runs on a schedule defined in `config.yaml`. By default, it performs weekly maintenance tasks on all accessible repositories.

You can also trigger maintenance manually using the web interface or by running `python main.py --repo=<repository_name>`.

Advanced usage options:
- `python main.py --full-scan`: Perform a comprehensive analysis of all repositories
- `python main.py --security-audit`: Run a security-focused maintenance cycle
- `python main.py --generate-report`: Create a detailed report of recent maintenance activities

## Web Interface

Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`. Features include:

- Manual maintenance triggering for specific repositories or organization-wide
- Real-time logs and updates on ongoing maintenance tasks
- Repository activity report generation with customizable metrics
- Plugin management interface for activating and configuring plugins
- User management for multi-user setups
- Dashboard with key metrics and insights
- Scheduling interface for customizing maintenance routines

## Customizing the LLM Provider

To change the LLM provider, update the `LLM_PROVIDER` and `LLM_MODEL` variables in your `.env` file. Supported options:

- OpenAI: `LLM_PROVIDER=openai`, `LLM_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4`
- Anthropic: `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic`, `LLM_MODEL=claude-2` or `claude-instant-1`
- Groq: `LLM_PROVIDER=groq`, `LLM_MODEL=llama2-70b-4096` or `mixtral-8x7b-32768`
- Ollama: `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama`, `LLM_MODEL=llama2` or `codellama`

Custom LLM integration:
1. Create a new file in the `llm_providers/` directory (e.g., `custom_llm.py`)
2. Implement the required interface methods (initialize, generate_response)
3. Add your custom provider to the `LLM_PROVIDER` options in `config.yaml`

## Plugin System

AI GitHub Maintainer supports custom plugins to extend its functionality. For detailed information on creating and using plugins, refer to the [Plugin Development Guide](plugins_dev.md).

Key aspects of the plugin system:
- Hot-reloading of plugins for development
- Dependency management for plugin requirements
- Sandboxing for security isolation
- Performance profiling for plugin optimization
- Marketplace for sharing and discovering community plugins

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Workflows

Create custom maintenance workflows by chaining multiple plugins:

```yaml
workflows:
  security_audit:
    - security_scanner
    - dependency_checker
    - license_validator
  performance_optimization:
    - code_profiler
    - query_optimizer
    - cache_analyzer
```

### API Integration

Integrate the AI GitHub Maintainer into your existing tools and workflows using our RESTful API:

```python
import requests

api_url = "http://localhost:5000/api/v1"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer your_api_token"}

# Trigger maintenance for a specific repository
response = requests.post(f"{api_url}/maintain", json={"repo": "user/repo"}, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

### Automated Reporting

Schedule automated reports to be sent to stakeholders:

```yaml
reporting:
  schedule: "0 9 * * 1"  # Every Monday at 9 AM
  recipients:
    - dev-team@example.com
    - project-manager@example.com
  format: pdf
  sections:
    - security_summary
    - performance_metrics
    - code_quality_trends
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Rate Limiting**: If you encounter GitHub API rate limits, consider using a GitHub App instead of a personal access token for higher rate limits.

2. **Memory Usage**: For large repositories, you may need to increase the available memory. Use the `--memory-limit` flag:
   ```
   python main.py --memory-limit=8G
   ```

3. **Slow Performance**: Enable caching in `config.yaml` to speed up repeated operations:
   ```yaml
   caching:
     enabled: true
     backend: redis
     ttl: 3600
   ```

4. **Plugin Errors**: Check the plugin logs in `logs/plugins.log` for detailed error messages. Ensure all plugin dependencies are installed.

## FAQ

Q: Can I use AI GitHub Maintainer with self-hosted GitHub Enterprise?
A: Yes, specify your GitHub Enterprise URL in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
github:
  api_url: https://github.example.com/api/v3
```

Q: How does AI GitHub Maintainer handle sensitive data?
A: Sensitive data is never stored locally and is redacted from logs. All communications with LLM providers are encrypted.

Q: Can I use AI GitHub Maintainer with other version control systems?
A: Currently, only GitHub is supported, but we plan to add support for GitLab and Bitbucket in future releases.

## Performance Optimization

Tips for optimizing AI GitHub Maintainer performance:

1. Use the `--parallel` flag to run maintenance tasks concurrently:
   ```
   python main.py --parallel=4
   ```

2. Enable result caching to speed up repeated analyses:
   ```yaml
   caching:
     enabled: true
     backend: redis
   ```

3. Use a faster LLM provider for less complex tasks:
   ```yaml
   llm:
     provider: groq
     model: mixtral-8x7b-32768
   ```

4. Implement custom plugins for performance-critical tasks using compiled languages (e.g., Rust, Go) and use them via the plugin system.
